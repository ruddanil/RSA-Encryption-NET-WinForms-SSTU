# RSA-Encryption-NET-WinForms-SSTU
A demonstration program showcasing data encryption/decryption using the RSA algorithm with key management functionality. It also includes the capability of creating and verifying digital signatures.

The program implements the following functionality:

1. Generation of random public and private keys for the RSA asymmetric encryption algorithm.
2. Ability to export/import these keys to/from XML files.
3. Ability to encrypt/decrypt data files using the obtained public/private keys.
4. Creation of a digital signature using the RSA algorithm for a given file, saving the generated signature to a separate file.
5. Integrity verification of a given data file based on its digital signature stored in a separate file.
